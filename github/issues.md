# GitHub Issues Guidelines

## Purpose

Provide a structure for creating GitHub issues to ensure clarity and facilitate issue triage and resolution.

## What to Include in an Issue

- **Title:** A clear, concise description of the issue.
- **Description:** Detailed explanation including context, expected behavior, and observed behavior.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** A step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
- **Environment:** Details about the affected system, version numbers, and any relevant logs.
- **Labels:** Use appropriate labels as outlined in [labels.md](labels.md).

## Best Practices

- Use the provided [Issue Template](../templates/issue-template.md) when creating a new issue.
- Reference related pull requests, commits, or issues if relevant.
- Keep the issue comments focused on a single concern for clarity.
